### üêõ How to report bugs ?

You could simply click the ```Issues``` tab at the top of this page and create an issue. 
It would be much more helpful if you could provide **the steps to produce the bugs and screenshots** along. 
You are welcome to create an issue in Chinese or English. 
I will review your issue ASAP.

### üåü How to suggest new features ?

Similar to reporting bugs, you could simply create an issue with title ```Suggestion: xxxxx```.
Again, you are welcome to create the suggestions in Chinese or English. 
And I will reply you ASAP.

### ‚úçüèª How to contribute in translation ?

You could click the ```Download``` button at right top corner to download all the translation. 
All the translation files are in the ```Translations``` folder. 
If you want to create a new language, just simply copy an existing language folder and rename it to new [language code](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php). i.e. ```zh-HK``` to ```ja```.
You can edit those file using Wordpad, but we recommand you to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) which is more powerful.
