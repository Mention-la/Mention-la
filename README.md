### üêõ How to report bugs ?

You could simply click the ```Issues``` tab at the top of this page and create an issue.

### ‚úçüèª How to contribute in translation ?

You could click the ```Download``` button at right top corner to download all the translation.
All the translation files are in the ```Translations``` folder.  
If you want to create a new language, just simply copy an existing language folder and rename it to new [language code](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php). i.e. ```zh-HK``` to ```ja```.  
You can edit those file using Wordpad, but I recommand you to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) which is more powerful.
